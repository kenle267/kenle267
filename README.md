I'm a software developer from Sacramento, California!

My primary tech stack consists of React, TypeScript, and Tailwind, 
but I am constantly learning and experimenting with new technologies.

Right now, I am learning 
- backend fundamentals (APIs, data flow, reliability)
- automation & tooling
- practical AI integration.

I pinned some of my favorite projects for you to check out if you are interested.

### 😄 Outside of Programming 
In my free time, I like to stay active.

My hobbies include basketball, weightlifting, traveling, 
and trying new things with friends!
